# Value Demonstration

## Definition

Value Demonstration is the practice of proving capability through tangible deliverables rather than claims. It's the mechanism behind [[Show Don't Tell]] - creating artifacts that showcase your ability to contribute.

## Forms of Value Demonstration

### In Job Hunting (from the article)

**Research & Analysis**:
- Market research reports on community building strategies
- Competitor analysis and positioning recommendations
- Customer interview insights and synthesis

**Process Documentation**:
- Hiring funnel analysis with bottleneck identification
- User journey mapping with improvement suggestions
- Engagement data analysis (e.g., LinkedIn comment scraping)

**Strategic Proposals**:
- Content marketing roadmaps
- Outreach strategies for potential customers
- Solutions to identified operational problems

### Investment Required

The article recommends **30 minutes to 1 hour per company**. More if desperate for a job, but not much more - the goal is to demonstrate capability, not do free consulting.

## Why It Works

Value demonstration addresses the core hiring risk: **uncertainty about contribution**.

For specialists, contribution is predictable:
- Engineers write code
- Salespeople close deals

For generalists, contribution is uncertain:
- What will they work on?
- How long until they're productive?
- Will they need constant direction?

Demonstrating value answers these questions before the hire, reducing perceived risk.

## The Negative Value Problem

The article notes: "Many new employees actually contribute negative value, particularly in their first few months."

This accounts for:
- Opportunity cost of time spent onboarding
- Context building required before contribution
- Risk of bad hires consuming resources

Value demonstration flips this: you contribute *before* being hired, proving you can be productive from day one.

## Ethical Considerations

Questions worth considering:
- When does value demonstration become free labor?
- Does this advantage candidates with more time/resources?
- Should companies expect this level of pre-hire work?

The 30-60 minute guideline suggests reasonable boundaries, but lines can blur.
