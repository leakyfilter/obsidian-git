# Generalist Career

## Definition

A generalist career path characterized by broad capabilities across domains rather than deep specialization in one area. Generalists describe themselves with abstract terms like "strategic thinker," "problem solver," or "creative hustler" rather than concrete job titles.

## The Identity Challenge

Unlike specialists (software engineers, salespeople, designers), generalists lack clear nomenclature for their skillset. This creates friction in:
- Job applications (what role to apply for?)
- Networking (how to introduce yourself?)
- Personal branding (what's your LinkedIn headline?)

The article argues: **stop worrying about the label**. Terminology and optics matter far less than demonstrating value via [[Show Don't Tell]].

## Why Generalists Are Hard to Hire

From a founder/hiring manager perspective:

**Clear value for specialists**:
- Software engineer → they build features
- Salesperson → they close deals
- Designer → they create interfaces

**Unclear value for generalists**:
- Where will they contribute?
- What context do they need to succeed?
- How do you evaluate their impact?

This uncertainty makes generalists risky hires, especially given:
- High opportunity cost of onboarding
- Many new employees contribute **negative value** in first months
- Unclear how to allocate their time productively

## The Generalist's Advantage

Despite hiring friction, generalists excel at:
- **Cross-functional synthesis**: Connecting dots across domains
- **Adaptive problem-solving**: Thriving in ambiguous situations
- **Organizational glue**: Filling gaps that specialists miss

These are precisely the skills early-stage startups need, but they're hard to evaluate via resumes alone.

## Strategy for Generalists

Use [[Show Don't Tell]] to overcome the evaluation problem:
1. Identify a company's high-value problem
2. Do preliminary work addressing it
3. Present findings/solutions when reaching out
4. Prove you can self-direct and contribute autonomously
