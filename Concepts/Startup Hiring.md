# Startup Hiring

## Definition

Startup hiring refers to the talent acquisition process at early-stage companies, characterized by high uncertainty, resource constraints, and need for autonomous contributors who can operate without extensive guidance.

## Unique Constraints

### Time as Scarcest Resource

For founders and hiring managers:
- Every hour spent onboarding is an hour not spent building or selling
- Opportunity cost of training is high
- Many new employees contribute **negative value** initially

This makes hiring decisions higher-stakes than at established companies with dedicated onboarding infrastructure.

### Role Clarity for Specialists vs Generalists

**Clear contribution path (easy to hire)**:
- Software engineers → build features
- Salespeople → close deals
- Designers → create interfaces

**Unclear contribution path (hard to hire)**:
- [[Generalist Career]] roles
- Operations
- "Strategic" positions
- "Wear many hats" roles

The lack of clarity increases perceived risk, making generalists harder to evaluate despite being valuable.

## What Startups Actually Need

Early-stage startups focus on two things:
1. **Building stuff** (product development)
2. **Selling stuff** (customer acquisition)

Generalists must connect their value to one or both of these core activities.

## The Two-Sided Market

**Candidate perspective**:
- Hard to know if role/company is good fit before joining
- Want to avoid wasting time on bad matches
- Need to differentiate from other applicants

**Company perspective**:
- Hard to evaluate generalist contribution potential
- Can't afford bad hires (negative value risk)
- Need people who self-direct, not require hand-holding

[[Show Don't Tell]] and [[Value Demonstration]] bridge this information asymmetry.

## Hiring at Different Scales

The article gives examples at different startup stages:

**Larger startup** (Meter - 60 open roles, $170M Series C):
- More structured hiring process
- Clearer role definitions
- More opportunities to specialize

**Smaller startup** (Meridian - <10 people, recently launched):
- Extremely hands-on
- Less defined processes
- More direct founder access

Strategy adapts to scale: larger companies might value process improvements, smaller companies might value customer development work.
