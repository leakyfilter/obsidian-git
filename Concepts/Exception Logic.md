# Exception Logic

## Definition

Exception logic refers to the rules, precedents, and judgment calls that govern deviations from standard policies - the "it depends" layer that makes real business decisions messy.

## Explanation

Standard policies define what *should* happen. Exception logic governs what happens when standard policies don't apply:

- When is a discount above policy limit acceptable?
- Which customers get special treatment and why?
- When do you escalate vs. handle directly?
- Who can approve deviations and under what circumstances?

This logic often lives in people's heads as [[Tribal Knowledge]] rather than being systematically captured.

## Why It's a Signal for AI Opportunity

Exception-heavy decisions are where [[Systems of Agents]] have the most opportunity. Routine, deterministic workflows don't need [[Decision Traces]] - the agent just executes. The valuable surfaces are where:

- Logic is complex
- Precedent matters
- "It depends" is the honest answer

Examples: deal desks, underwriting, compliance reviews, escalation management.
