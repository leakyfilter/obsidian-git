# Tribal Knowledge

## Definition

Tribal knowledge is institutional expertise that exists only in employees' heads, passed down through onboarding, side conversations, and informal mentorship rather than documented in systems.

## Explanation

Tribal knowledge represents the gap between what systems capture and what people actually need to know to do their jobs. It includes:

- [[Exception Logic]] ("We always give healthcare companies an extra 10% because their procurement cycles are brutal")
- Precedent awareness ("We structured a similar deal for Company X last quarter")
- Cross-system synthesis (knowing to check multiple tools and Slack threads before deciding)
- Unwritten approval chains ("You need VP sign-off for this, even though the system doesn't require it")

## Why It Matters for AI

Agents run into the same ambiguity humans resolve with judgment and organizational memory. But if tribal knowledge isn't stored as durable artifacts, agents can't access it.

This is a key limitation of adding AI to existing [[Systems of Record]] - the knowledge agents need often doesn't exist in those systems.

## The Context Graph Solution

[[Context Graph]]s can capture tribal knowledge by persisting [[Decision Traces]]: the reasoning, exceptions, and precedents that inform decisions. Over time, implicit tribal knowledge becomes explicit, queryable precedent.
