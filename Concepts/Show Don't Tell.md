# Show Don't Tell

## Definition

Show Don't Tell is a strategy for demonstrating capability through tangible work products rather than abstract claims about skills or potential. Instead of saying "I'm a strategic thinker," you produce strategic analysis. Instead of claiming "I can add value anywhere," you identify and execute valuable work.

## Explanation

The principle applies particularly well to [[Generalist Career]] paths and [[Startup Hiring]] contexts, where it's less obvious what someone will contribute compared to specialized roles like engineering or sales.

### Why Telling Doesn't Work

When candidates say "I can take on any responsibilities" or "I'm a problem solver," they actually frame themselves as someone who:
- Needs to be told what to do
- Requires significant onboarding investment
- May contribute negative value initially (due to opportunity cost of training)

### What Showing Looks Like

Concrete examples from startup job hunting:
- Research a company's community building strategy and compile insights
- Document their hiring funnel and propose improvements
- Interview potential customers and share findings
- Analyze founder's social media engagement and suggest outreach tactics
- Create a presentation on product UX improvements

## The Underlying Principle

There's a fundamental difference between:
- **Claiming capability** (telling): "I'm good at X"
- **Demonstrating capability** (showing): Here's X that I did

Showing eliminates uncertainty and proves you can:
1. Identify valuable work autonomously
2. Execute without hand-holding
3. Contribute from day one

## Broader Applications

While the source article focuses on job hunting, the principle generalizes:
- **Content creation**: Write the article instead of claiming you can write
- **Building in public**: Ship the prototype instead of talking about the idea
- **Collaboration**: Contribute to the project before asking to join officially

- Can this principle be abused by companies expecting free labor?
