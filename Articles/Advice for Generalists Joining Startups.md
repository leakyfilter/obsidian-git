## Summary

Career advice for people with generalist backgrounds trying to join startups. The core thesis: stop worrying about how to label yourself ("strategic thinker," "problem solver") and instead **show, don't tell**. Demonstrate value before being hired by identifying useful work, doing preliminary research, or creating artifacts that prove you can contribute without hand-holding. This approach differentiates you from candidates who simply apply and wait.

## Key Points

### The Generalist's Dilemma
- Engineers call themselves "software engineers," salespeople call themselves "salespeople"
- Generalists struggle with labels: "strategic thinker," "creative hustler," "problem solver"
- **Author's take**: Stop wasting time on optics and terminology - it rarely matters at startups

### Show, Don't Tell Approach

**Why most approaches fail**:
- Default: Apply via portal, let resume do the talking
- Slightly better: Cold email saying "I can take on any responsibilities"
- Problem: This frames you as someone who needs to be told what to do

**The real cost of hiring**:
- Time is the scarcest resource for founders
- Onboarding has high opportunity cost
- Many new employees contribute **negative value** in first few months
- For generalists, it's unclear where they'll drive value

**The solution**: Prove you can identify (and do!) useful work *before* being hired

### Concrete Examples

**For Meter (infrastructure startup, 60 open roles)**:
- Research IT community building strategies, compile learnings about brand opportunities
- Document their hiring process, identify bottlenecks, propose solutions
- Find early employees on LinkedIn, research their domain (e.g., data centers), send insights report

**For Meridian (AI search platform, <10 people)**:
- Sign up for product, document user journey, create presentation on funnel improvements
- Find 10 target customers, interview them about product interest, share insights
- Analyze founder's LinkedIn engagement, scrape comments, categorize responders, suggest outreach strategy

### Time Investment
- 30 minutes to 1 hour per company (not more, unless you desperately need the job)
- Try with 3-5 companies to see results

## Quotes

> "There's a big difference between hiring someone who needs to be told what to do and hiring someone who can figure out how to be valuable on their own."

> "If you are actually a generalist, if you are actually someone who can 'plug in anywhere' and exercise your strategic thinking skills, then do it! Show, not tell."

> "Many new employees actually contribute negative value, particularly in their first few months of the new job."

## My Thoughts

The examples are highly actionable and specific, which makes this advice more valuable than typical "be proactive" platitudes. The 30-60 minute time guideline is particularly useful - it prevents over-investing in companies that may not respond.
